How to report a bug
-------------------

Report bugs on the `Issue Tracker`_.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.


How to request a feature

Request features on the `Issue Tracker`_.


How to set up your development environment
------------------------------------------

You need Python 3.7+ and the following tools:

- Poetry_
- Nox_
- nox-poetry_

Install the package with development requirements:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry install

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run python
   $ poetry run human-readable

.. _Poetry: https://python-poetry.org/
.. _Nox: https://nox.thea.codes/
.. _nox-poetry: https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/


How to test the project
-----------------------

Run the full test suite:

.. code:: console

   $ nox

List the available Nox sessions:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --list-sessions

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests

Unit tests are located in the ``tests`` directory,
and are written using the pytest_ testing framework.

.. _pytest: https://pytest.readthedocs.io/


How to add a new locale
-----------------------

Make sure you have installed a PO Editor, you can easily install that on a Debian-based system with:

.. code:: console

   apt install poedit

To add a new locale you need to execute:

.. code:: console

   xgettext --from-code=UTF-8 -o human_readable.pot -k'_' -k'N_' -k'P_:1c,2' -l python src/human_readable/*.py  # extract new phrases
   msginit -i human_readable.pot -o human_readable/locale/<locale name>/LC_MESSAGES/human_readable.po --locale <locale name>

Then edit your .po file in the locale folder that got created.

If possible, add tests to `tests/functional/new_locale`. Run them with:

.. code:: console

   nox -s tests


How to submit changes
---------------------

Open a `pull request`_ to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before commiting your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=pre-commit -- install

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
